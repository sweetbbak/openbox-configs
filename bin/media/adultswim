### EXAMPLE COMMAND: ADULT_SWIM-YTDLP robot-chicken

## You Must ONLY PROVIDE the Show's URL Slug
### JUST FIND THE Show's URL, AND REMOVE "https://www.adultswim.com/videos/" LEAVING JUST THE SHOW'S URL SLUG
## Example: https://www.adultswim.com/videos/robot-chicken --> robot-chicken
URL_SLUG=$1

## Now The Script Will Parse The Show's Page Using XIDEL and Grab Episode URLS VIA XPATHs
## One By One, The Episodes Will Be Downloaded Until They Are All Grabbed
